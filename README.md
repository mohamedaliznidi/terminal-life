## üìñ About

Conway's Game of Life, created by mathematician John Conway in 1970, is a fascinating cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of life on a grid. Despite its name, it's not a traditional game but rather a zero-player simulation where the evolution is determined by the initial state and four simple rules:

1. **Underpopulation**: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies
2. **Survival**: Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives
3. **Overpopulation**: Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
4. **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive

These deceptively simple rules create incredibly complex and beautiful patterns, from stable structures to oscillators and even "spaceships" that move across the grid.

## ‚ú® Features

### üéÆ Interactive Simulation
- **Click to toggle cells** - Build your own patterns by clicking on the grid

## üéØ Performance Optimizations

This implementation prioritizes performance through several key optimizations:

### Canvas Rendering
- Uses HTML5 Canvas instead of DOM elements for 60fps performance
- Batches rendering operations for efficiency
- Leverages `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations

### React Optimizations
- **Memoization**: Extensive use of `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Immutable state management**: Ensures predictable updates and enables React's optimization strategies
- **Component separation**: Clear separation of concerns between game logic, UI controls, and rendering

### Memory Management
- Efficient grid data structures
- Minimal object allocations during simulation
- Optimized neighbor counting algorithms

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a modular, component-based architecture:

- **Game Logic**: Pure functions for calculating next generations
- **State Management**: React hooks with immutable state updates
- **Rendering**: Canvas-based high-performance grid display
- **UI Components**: Reusable, accessible interface elements
- **Pattern System**: Modular pattern definitions and management
